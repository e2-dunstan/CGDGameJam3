## Teamwork and Project Development

### GitHub

Third time's a charm. GitHub was heavily utilised this time around, with good use of issues, projects and priorities. Milestones were not needed due to the core issues being completed in the first weekend.

### Communication

Fantastic. Some instances where members were late or could not make it, but slack communication stayed consistent and coherent. Everybody knew what they were doing and just cracked on. Everyone pulled their weight.

#
## The Game

### Code

Not as heavy in this game. The gameplay was mostly created through the atmosphere from Unity's lighting and animations.

### Design

Level Design (maze generator) - Lewis

Characters - Ellie

UI - Sol

Effects (wall torches, footsteps, etc.) - Sol

Keys - Alex, Ben, Sol (emphasise communication on this issue, plus use of colours)

Enemies - Dan

Torch - Ben

#
## Improvements

Level - more variety, static objects like clutter

Clearer visual cues? I.e. keys needed
